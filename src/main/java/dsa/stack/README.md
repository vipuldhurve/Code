## Identification
- Problems pertaining to `Arrays or Strings.`
- Stack implementation might be applicable, especially when there is a `nested loop structure where the inner loop depends on the outer loop` as exemplified by the following code snippet:

###### Example of Nested Loop Dependency Structure
```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        // --some code--
    }
}
